# Introduction

Precise eye center localization constitutes a very promising but challenging task in many human interaction
applications due to many limitations related with the presence of photometric distortions and occlusions as well
as pose and shape variations. 

## Network Architecture

This sample code tests the DeepPupilNet eye center localizer, which was trained on MUCT, BioID and Gi4E face databases. This script requires the Deep Learning Toolbox.

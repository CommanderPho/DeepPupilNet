# Introduction

Precise eye center localization constitutes a very promising but challenging task in many human interaction
applications due to many limitations related with the presence of photometric distortions and occlusions as well
as pose and shape variations. 

This sample code tests the DeepPupilNet eye center localizer, which was 
trained on MUCT, BioID and Gi4E face databases. This script requires the 
Deep Learning Toolbox.
